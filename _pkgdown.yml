    desc: Base class and three families of samplers (Marginal, Conditional, Knockoff)
  - subtitle: Base classes
    desc: |
      Abstract base classes for the three sampler families. FeatureSampler is the top-level base class,
      MarginalSampler is for marginal sampling methods, and ConditionalSampler is for conditional sampling methods.
    contents:
      - FeatureSampler
      - MarginalSampler
      - ConditionalSampler
  - subtitle: Marginal sampling (no conditioning)
    desc: |
      Samplers that draw from the marginal distribution P(X_S) without conditioning on other features.
    contents:
      - MarginalPermutationSampler
      - MarginalReferenceSampler
  - subtitle: Conditional sampling (with conditioning)
    desc: |
      Samplers that draw from the conditional distribution P(X_S | X_C) where X_C is an arbitrary conditioning set.
      The conditioning set can be specified via the `conditioning_set` parameter.
    contents:
      - ConditionalARFSampler
      - ConditionalGaussianSampler
      - ConditionalKNNSampler
      - ConditionalCtreeSampler
  - subtitle: Knockoff sampling
    desc: |
      Knockoffs satisfy certain theoretical properties that exceed those of the conditional samplers.
      They generate one (or more) knockoff matrix on construction, and sampling is always performed
      in reference to these. Unlike other samplers, they do not allow sampling from new data with `$sample_newdata()`,
      as that would require re-creating a knockoff matrix on the fly.
