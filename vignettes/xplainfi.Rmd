The **xplainfi** package provides feature importance methods for machine learning models. It implements several approaches for measuring how much each feature contributes to model predictions, with a focus on model-agnostic methods that work with any learner.

## Core Concepts

Feature importance methods in xplainfi address different but related questions:

- **How much does each feature contribute to model performance?** (Permutation Feature Importance)
- **What happens when we remove features and retrain?** (Leave-One-Covariate-Out)  
- **How do features depend on each other?** (Conditional and Relative methods)

All methods share a common interface built on [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/), making them easy to use with any task, learner, measure, and resampling strategy. 

The general pattern is to call `$compute()` to calculate importance (which _always re-computes_), then `$importance()` to retrieve the aggregated results, with intermediate results available in `$scores`.

## Basic Example

Let's use the Friedman1 task, which provides an ideal setup for demonstrating feature importance methods with known ground truth:

```{r setup-problem}
task <- tgen("friedman1")$generate(n = 300)
learner <- lrn("regr.ranger", num.trees = 100)
measure <- msr("regr.mse")
resampling <- rsmp("cv", folds = 3)
```

The task has `r task$nrow` observations with `r length(task$feature_names)` features. Features `important1` through `important5` truly affect the target, while `unimportant1` through `unimportant5` are pure noise. We'll use a random forest learner with cross-validation for more stable estimates.

The target function is: $y = 10 * \operatorname{sin}(\pi * x_1 * x_2) + 20 * (x_3 - 0.5)^2 + 10 * x_4 + 5 * x_5 + \epsilon$


## Permutation Feature Importance (PFI)

PFI is the most straightforward method: for each feature, we permute (shuffle) its values and measure how much model performance deteriorates. More important features cause larger performance drops when shuffled.

```{r pfi-basic}
pfi <- PFI$new(
	task = task,
	learner = learner,
	measure = measure,
	resampling = resampling
)

pfi$compute()
pfi$importance()
```

The `importance` column shows the performance difference when each feature is permuted. Higher values indicate more important features.

For more stable estimates, we can use multiple permutation iterations per resampling fold:

```{r pfi-parameters}
pfi_stable <- PFI$new(
	task = task,
	learner = learner,
	measure = measure,
	resampling = resampling,
	n_repeats = 5
)

pfi_stable$compute()
pfi_stable$importance()
```

We can also use ratio instead of difference for the importance calculation, meaning that an unimportant feature is now expected to get an importance score of 1 rather than 0:

```{r pfi-ratio}
pfi_stable$importance(relation = "ratio")
```


## Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)

LOCO measures importance by retraining the model without each feature and comparing performance to the full model. This shows the contribution of each feature when all other features are present.

```{r loco-basic}
loco <- LOCO$new(
	task = task,
	learner = learner,
	measure = measure,
	resampling = resampling
)

loco$compute()
loco$importance()
```

LOCO is computationally expensive (requires retraining for each feature) but provides clear interpretation: higher values mean larger performance drop when the feature is removed. **Important limitation**: LOCO cannot distinguish between direct effects and indirect effects through correlated features.

## Feature Samplers

For advanced methods that account for feature dependencies, xplainfi provides different sampling strategies. While PFI uses simple permutation (marginal sampling), conditional samplers can preserve feature relationships.

Let's demonstrate conditional sampling using Adversarial Random Forests, which preserves relationships between features when sampling:

```{r samplers-demo}
arf_sampler <- ConditionalARFSampler$new(task)

sample_data <- task$data(rows = 1:5)
sample_data[, .(important1, important2)]
```

Now we'll conditionally sample the `important1` feature given the values of `important2` and `important3`:

```{r conditional-sampling}
sampled_conditional <- arf_sampler$sample_newdata(
	feature = "important1",
	newdata = sample_data,
	conditioning_set = c("important2", "important3")
)

sample_data[, .(important1, important2, important3)]
sampled_conditional[, .(important1, important2, important3)]
```

This conditional sampling is essential for methods like CFI and RFI that need to preserve feature dependencies. See `vignette("perturbation-importance")` for detailed comparisons.

## Advanced Features

xplainfi supports many advanced features for robust importance estimation:

- **Multiple resampling strategies**: Cross-validation, bootstrap, custom splits
- **Multiple permutation/refit iterations**: For more stable estimates
- **Feature grouping**: Compute importance for groups of related features
- **Different relation types**: Difference vs. ratio scoring
- **Conditional sampling**: Account for feature dependencies (see `vignette("perturbation-importance")`)
- **SAGE methods**: Shapley-based approaches (see `vignette("sage-methods")`)

## Detailed Scoring Information

All methods store detailed scoring information from each resampling iteration for further analysis. Let's examine the structure of PFI's detailed scores:

```{r detailed-scores}
pfi$scores() |>
	head(10) |>
	knitr::kable(digits = 4, caption = "Detailed PFI scores (first 10 rows)")
```

We can also summarize the scoring structure:

```{r scoring-summary}
pfi$scores()[, .(
	features = uniqueN(feature),
	resampling_folds = uniqueN(iter_rsmp),
	permutation_iters = uniqueN(iter_repeat),
	total_scores = .N
)]
```

So `$importance()` always gives us the aggregated importances across multiple resampling- and permutation-/refitting iterations, whereas `$scores()` gives you the individual scores as calculated by the supplied `measures` and the corresponding importance calculated from the difference of these scores by default.

Analogously to `$importance()`, you can also use `relation = "ratio"` here:

```{r detailed-scores-ratio}
pfi$scores(relation = "ratio") |>
	head(10) |>
	knitr::kable(digits = 4, caption = "PFI scores using the ratio (first 10 rows)")
```

## Observation-wise losses and importances

For methods where importances are calculated based on observation-level comparisons and with decomposable measures, we can also retrieve observation-level information with `$obs_loss()`, which works analogously to `$scores()` and `$importances()` but even more detailed:


```{r pfi-obs-scores}
pfi$obs_loss()
```

Since we computed PFI using the mean squared error (`msr("regr.mse")`), we can use the associated `Measure$obs_loss()`, the squared error.  
In the resulting table we see 

- `loss_baseline`: The loss (squared error) for the baseline model before permutation
- `loss_post`: The loss for this observation after permutation (or in the case of `LOCO`, after refit)
- `obs_importance`: The difference (or ratio if `relation = "ratio"`) of the the two losses

Note that not all measures have a `Measure$obs_loss()`:
Some measures like `msr("classif.auc")` are not decomposable, so observation-wise loss values are not available.  
In other cases, the corresponding `obs_loss()` is just not yet implemented in [`mlr3measures`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr3measures/index.html), but will likely be in the future.
