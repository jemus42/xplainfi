# xplainfi 0.1.0.9000

- Extend `ARFSampler` to store more arguments on construction, making it easier to "preconfigure" the sampler via arguments used in `$sample()`.
- Standardize on `conditioning_set` as the name for the character vector defining features to condition on in `ConditionalSampler` and `RFI`.
- Streamline `PerturbationImportance` implementation

# xplainfi 0.1.0

- Initial prototype with 
	- PFI
	- CFI and RFI (via `arf`-powered conditional sampling)
	- SAGE (marginal and conditional, the latter via `arf`)
	- LOCO and LOCI
- Includes comparison to reference implementation in Python via `fippy`

# xplainfi 0.0.0.9000 (development version)

* Initial design phase.
