\usage{
sim_dgp_correlated(n = 500L)

sim_dgp_mediated(n = 500L)

sim_dgp_confounded(n = 500L, hidden = TRUE)

sim_dgp_interactions(n = 500L)

sim_dgp_independent(n = 500L)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{(\code{integer(1)}: \code{500L}) Number of observations to generate.}

\item{hidden}{(\code{logical(1)}: \code{TRUE}) Whether to hide the confounder from the returned task.
If \code{FALSE}, the confounder is included as a feature, allowing direct adjustment.
If \code{TRUE} (default), only the proxy is available, simulating unmeasured confounding.}
}
\value{
A regression task (\link[mlr3:TaskRegr]{mlr3::TaskRegr}) with \link[data.table:data.table]{data.table} backend.

\description{
These data generating processes (DGPs) are designed to illustrate specific
strengths and weaknesses of different feature importance methods like PFI, CFI, and RFI.
Each DGP focuses on one primary challenge to make the differences between methods clear.
}
\details{
\strong{Correlated Features DGP:}
This DGP creates highly correlated predictors where PFI will show artificially low
importance due to redundancy, while CFI will correctly identify each feature's
conditional contribution.

\strong{Mathematical Model:}
\deqn{X_1 \sim N(0,1)}
\deqn{X_2 = X_1 + \varepsilon_2, \quad \varepsilon_2 \sim N(0, 0.05^2)}
\deqn{X_3 \sim N(0,1), \quad X_4 \sim N(0,1)}
\deqn{Y = 2 \cdot X_1 + 1.5 \cdot X_2 + X_3 + \varepsilon}
where \eqn{\varepsilon \sim N(0, 0.2^2)}.

\strong{Feature Properties:}
\itemize{
\item \code{x1}: Standard normal, direct effect on y
\item \code{x2}: Nearly perfect copy of x1 (x1 + small noise), with r ≈ 0.999
\item \code{x3}: Independent standard normal, direct effect on y
\item \code{x4}: Independent standard normal, no effect on y
}

\strong{Expected Behavior:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{PFI}: Will show high importance for x1 and x2 (permutation breaks correlation structure)
\item \strong{CFI}: Will show low importance for x1 and x2 (they are redundant given each other)
\item \strong{Interpretation}: PFI measures marginal importance, CFI measures conditional importance
\item \strong{Ground truth}: Both x1 and x2 have causal effects, x3 has effect, x4 has none
}

\strong{Mediated Effects DGP:}
This DGP demonstrates the difference between total and direct causal effects.
Some features affect the outcome only through mediators.

\strong{Mathematical Model:}
\deqn{\text{exposure} \sim N(0,1), \quad \text{direct} \sim N(0,1)}
\deqn{\text{mediator} = 0.8 \cdot \text{exposure} + 0.6 \cdot \text{direct} + \varepsilon_m}
\deqn{Y = 1.5 \cdot \text{mediator} + 0.5 \cdot \text{direct} + \varepsilon}
where \eqn{\varepsilon_m \sim N(0, 0.3^2)} and \eqn{\varepsilon \sim N(0, 0.2^2)}.

\strong{Feature Properties:}
\itemize{
\item \code{exposure}: Has no direct effect on y, only through mediator (total effect = 1.2)
\item \code{mediator}: Mediates the effect of exposure on y
\item \code{direct}: Has both direct effect on y and effect on mediator
\item \code{noise}: No causal relationship to y
}

\strong{Causal Structure:} exposure → mediator → y ← direct → mediator

\strong{Expected Behavior:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{PFI}: Shows total effects (exposure appears important)
\item \strong{CFI}: Shows direct effects (exposure appears less important when conditioning on mediator)
\item \strong{RFI with mediator}: Should show direct effects similar to CFI
}

\strong{Confounding DGP:}
This DGP includes a confounder that affects both features and the outcome.
Uses simple coefficients for easy interpretation.

\strong{Mathematical Model:}
\deqn{H \sim N(0,1)}
\deqn{X_1 = H + \varepsilon_1, \quad X_2 = H + \varepsilon_2}
\deqn{\text{proxy} = H + \varepsilon_p, \quad \text{independent} \sim N(0,1)}
\deqn{Y = H + 0.5 \cdot X_1 + 0.5 \cdot X_2 + \text{independent} + \varepsilon}
where all \eqn{\varepsilon \sim N(0, 0.5^2)} independently.

\strong{Model Structure:}
\itemize{
\item Confounder H ~ N(0,1) (dashed red node = potentially unobserved)
\item x1 = H + noise, x2 = H + noise (both affected by confounder)
\item proxy = H + noise (noisy measurement of confounder)
\item independent ~ N(0,1) (truly independent)
\item y = H + 0.5\emph{x1 + 0.5}x2 + independent + noise
}

\strong{Expected Behavior:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{PFI}: Will show inflated importance for x1 and x2 due to confounding
\item \strong{CFI}: Should partially account for confounding through conditional sampling
\item \strong{RFI conditioning on confounder/proxy}: Should reduce confounding bias
}

\strong{Interaction Effects DGP:}
This DGP demonstrates a pure interaction effect where features have no main effects.

\strong{Mathematical Model:}
\deqn{Y = 2 \cdot X_1 \cdot X_2 + X_3 + \varepsilon}
where \eqn{X_j \sim N(0,1)} independently and \eqn{\varepsilon \sim N(0, 0.5^2)}.

\strong{Feature Properties:}
\itemize{
\item \code{x1}, \code{x2}: Independent features with ONLY interaction effect (no main effects)
\item \code{x3}: Independent feature with main effect only
\item \code{noise1}, \code{noise2}: No causal effects
}

\strong{Expected Behavior:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{PFI}: Should assign near-zero importance to x1 and x2 (no marginal effect)
\item \strong{CFI}: Should capture the interaction and assign high importance to x1 and x2
\item \strong{Ground truth}: x1 and x2 are important ONLY through their interaction
}

\strong{Independent Features DGP:}
This is a baseline scenario where all features are independent and their
effects are additive. All importance methods should give similar results.

\strong{Mathematical Model:}
\deqn{Y = 2.0 \cdot X_1 + 1.0 \cdot X_2 + 0.5 \cdot X_3 + \varepsilon}
where \eqn{X_j \sim N(0,1)} independently and \eqn{\varepsilon \sim N(0, 0.2^2)}.

\strong{Feature Properties:}
\itemize{
\item \code{important1-3}: Independent features with different effect sizes
\item \code{unimportant1-2}: Independent noise features with no effect
}

\strong{Expected Behavior:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{All methods}: Should rank features consistently by their true effect sizes
\item \strong{Ground truth}: important1 > important2 > important3 > unimportant1,2 ≈ 0
}
